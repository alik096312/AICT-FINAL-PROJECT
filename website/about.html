                <h2>1850</h2>
                <p>"Our journey began in a quiet village where our founder baked the very first batch of cookies. Using family recipes 
                    passed down for generations, every cookie was made with care and love. These homemade treats quickly became a favorite 
                    among the locals, bringing people together over tea and laughter. This humble beginning planted the seeds for our cookie 
                    legacy."</p>

                <p>"In this year, we introduced our iconic chocolate chip cookies, which became an instant hit. The bakery grew busier as people came from nearby towns to taste these sweet delights. It was also a time when we started experimenting with new flavors and ingredients, adding more variety to our menu.. This marked the beginning of our commitment to innovation in baking."</p>
